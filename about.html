            <p>The British Council was founded to create a friendly knowledge and understanding between the people of
                the UK and the wider world. We call this work cultural relations.

                We work in over 100 countries, connecting millions of people with the United Kingdom through programmes
                and services in the English language, the Arts, Education and Society. We believe these are the most
                effective means of engaging with others, and we have been doing this work since 1934.

                Our work in English aims to bring high quality language materials to every learner and teacher who wants
                them. In developing and post-conflict countries we teach English and train teachers through radio, web
                and TV broadcasts. We offer over three million UK examinations worldwide, helping people gain access to
                trusted qualifications to support their career and study prospects.</p>
